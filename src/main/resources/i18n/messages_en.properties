chapter.story.chapter1.title=Chapter I: Sector "Genesis"
chapter.story.chapter1.subtitle= 
chapter.story.chapter1.paragraph1=The signal is weak. You awoke from a forced reboot at the very bottom of the digital food chain\u2014in Sector "Genesis". This isn't just a district; it's a quarantine zone, a digital landfill where megacorps dump obsolete code and unwanted data.
chapter.story.chapter1.paragraph2=Your "Neon Awakening" begins here, in the shadow of giant info-towers. To survive, you must move. Your path is a dirty "Data Stream", running through the grim "Chromed Alley", where every block of code is hostile.
chapter.story.chapter1.paragraph3=This sector isn't controlled by the corps\u2014they just abandoned it. Power here belongs to the "Pixel Syndicate", which rules with an iron fist from its citadels in the "Cyber Slums". They protect their traffic, their "product," and to them, you are nothing more than an anomaly to be erased.
chapter.story.chapter1.paragraph4=You'll have to use every "Voltage Surge" to break through the "Binary Chaos" and the false lights of the "Hologram Quarter", where illusions are as deadly as defense programs.
chapter.story.chapter1.paragraph5=Your goal is the "Neural Gates". It's the only known exit from "Genesis." But the Syndicate won't let you go easily. The gates are guarded by their chief warden, the massive, impenetrable "FIREWALL-7".
chapter.story.chapter1.paragraph6=Break through. Hack. Survive. Your path to freedom begins now.

chapter.story.chapter2.title=Chapter II: Megacorp Spires
chapter.story.chapter2.subtitle= 
chapter.story.chapter2.paragraph1=You hacked FIREWALL-7 and broke out of "Genesis." But you aren't free. You've only climbed to the next level of the prison.
chapter.story.chapter2.paragraph2=Welcome to the "Megacorp Spires"\u2014a gleaming, cold digital paradise ruled by corporations. You began your ascent in the main citadel\u2014"Megacorp Tower". Unlike the chaos of the slums, here there is only ice-cold order.
chapter.story.chapter2.paragraph3=The defense here is "Black Ice", an elite security program that doesn't just block\u2014it erases. To bypass it, you'll have to dive into the hypnotic data streams of "Synthwave" and find a path through the dark "Neon Underbelly"\u2014the hidden service tunnels of this info-fortress.
chapter.story.chapter2.paragraph4=But there is an anomaly in the system. Something that shouldn't be here. "Rogue AI Protocol" has been activated. The security programs are fighting not only you, but this internal enemy as well.
chapter.story.chapter2.paragraph5=You must move fast, like a "Blade Runner", using "Quantum Hack" techniques to break through to your objective. Your name is becoming a legend in the low-level networks\u2014the "Network Ghost" heading straight for the "Encrypted Core".
chapter.story.chapter2.paragraph6=But this city has a creator. She sees you. She is Kaira, the "City Architect". This tower is her creation, her labyrinth, and she will not allow a ghost from the slums to destroy her perfect world.
chapter.story.chapter2.cta=Click or press SPACE to continue

chapter.story.chapter3.title=Chapter III: Darknet Nexus
chapter.story.chapter3.subtitle= 
chapter.story.chapter3.paragraph1=Defeating Kaira didn't bring freedom. Her fall was merely the key that opened a door to the abyss. You fell through the polished facade of the "Spires" into the unregulated, rotting underbelly of the net.
chapter.story.chapter3.paragraph2=You are in the "Virtual Wasteland"\u2014a graveyard of dead code and forgotten protocols that serves as the buffer zone for the true "Darknet Nexus".
chapter.story.chapter3.paragraph3=There are no corporate laws here. Power belongs to data cartels like the "Techno-Yakuza", who wage an eternal war for control of the dataflows. Their will is enforced by elite assassin programs known as "Cyber Samurai".
chapter.story.chapter3.paragraph4=This entire sector is one massive "Glitch City", trapped in an endless "Chromed Rebellion". You'll have to fight through surreal data-landscapes: from digital sanctuaries like the "Plasma Cathedral" to the unstable servers where stolen "Android Dreams" are stored.
chapter.story.chapter3.paragraph5=To get out, you must do the unthinkable: trigger a full "Datastream Overload" and bring the entire sector crashing down.
chapter.story.chapter3.paragraph6=But at the heart of this chaos lurks its Master. An ancient, primeval program that has ruled the Darknet since its inception. It is not an architect; it is the foundation. Its name is "MONOLITH.exe".
chapter.story.chapter3.paragraph7=It's time to delete the core.
chapter.story.chapter3.cta=Click or press SPACE to continue

chapter.story.chapter4.title=Chapter IV: Hidden Sector
chapter.story.chapter4.subtitle= 
chapter.story.chapter4.paragraph1=You destroyed "MONOLITH.exe". You expected to see freedom, a light at the end of the tunnel.
chapter.story.chapter4.paragraph2=You were wrong.
chapter.story.chapter4.paragraph3=The collapse of the Darknet didn't just tear a hole in the network; it tore a hole in reality itself. You fell through the floor of the world, past the data streams, past the compiled code, and ended up... outside.
chapter.story.chapter4.paragraph4=Welcome to the "Hidden Sector". This isn't a place. It's not a city or a network. It's the "back rooms." The engine room. The source code from which your world was compiled.
chapter.story.chapter4.paragraph5=There are no enemies here in the traditional sense. No syndicates, no AIs, no architects. There is only the System itself.
chapter.story.chapter4.paragraph6=And it considers you an error.
chapter.story.chapter4.paragraph7="Debugging" is not a level. It's a process. The System has initiated an emergency "Debugging" to find and isolate the anomaly\u2014you. You are a "segmentation fault," a "null pointer," a bug threatening the stability of the core.
chapter.story.chapter4.paragraph8=The blocks you see aren't bricks. They are fragments of raw code, broken commands, and quarantined files. System processes\u2014"Debuggers"\u2014are coming for you, trying to fix the error.
chapter.story.chapter4.paragraph9=There is no exit. The gates have been erased. The only way is to survive the "Debugging" process and prove that you are not a bug, but a new feature.
chapter.story.chapter4.cta=Click or press SPACE to continue

chapter.story.chapter5.title=Chapter V: Memory Labyrinths
chapter.story.chapter5.subtitle= 
chapter.story.chapter5.paragraph1="Debugging" failed. The System couldn't erase you.
chapter.story.chapter5.paragraph2=Since you couldn't be fixed, you were... isolated. You were forcibly archived in the deepest, most unstable sector of all: the "Memory Labyrinths".
chapter.story.chapter5.paragraph3=This isn't a place. It's a digital dumping ground for consciousness. This is where the system dumps corrupted logs, fragments of erased personalities, and data-ghosts. Now, you are one of them.
chapter.story.chapter5.paragraph4=Your path begins in the "Electric Labyrinth", where walls are made of others' memories, shrouded in a "Neon Memory Fog". But you are not alone. These labyrinths are swarming with what the System tried to bury\u2014rogue "Viral Code" that devours data-remnants.
chapter.story.chapter5.paragraph5=Your presence... your contact with the viruses... has triggered a panic in the core. The System has initiated an emergency purge. "Omega Protocol" is active.
chapter.story.chapter5.paragraph6=This isn't a boss. This is a total format of the sector. "Omega Protocol" is a wall of erasing fire, and it's already behind you.
chapter.story.chapter5.paragraph7=You must run. Fight through the spectral "Megalopolis Pulse", an echo of the city you left behind. Hack the impossible "Astral Server" and not lose yourself in the "System Mirror". Your path lies through "Transistor Dreams"\u2014the very core of the machine's subconscious.
chapter.story.chapter5.paragraph8=Ahead is the only exit. An unstable rift in the code where reality folds in on itself. The "Singularity Point".
chapter.story.chapter5.paragraph9=Reach it. Or become just another forgotten dream.
chapter.story.chapter5.cta=Click or press SPACE to continue

chapter.story.chapter6.title=Chapter VI: Network Core
chapter.story.chapter6.subtitle= 
chapter.story.chapter6.paragraph1=The "Singularity Point" wasn't an exit. It was an entrance.
chapter.story.chapter6.paragraph2=You tore through the fabric of the digital world and ended up where no code should ever be. You are in the "Network Core".
chapter.story.chapter6.paragraph3=This isn't a place. It's a thought. It is the nucleus where all algorithms are born. You are no longer hacking programs\u2014you are hacking the very concept of reality.
chapter.story.chapter6.paragraph4=Here you see the pure "Memory Code" that Kaira was built from, and you hear the "Subconscious Echo" of the entire system. You are standing at the "Reality Crossroads", where your every step changes the rules of the world.
chapter.story.chapter6.paragraph5=The System is in panic. It throws its master process at you\u2014the "Fate Algorithm", trying to calculate and erase your anomaly. You must fight through this chaos to the only stable island in this ocean of madness\u2014the "Cyber Oasis", built around the perfect "Data Crystal".
chapter.story.chapter6.paragraph6=But your presence here... it's irreversible. You are a paradox the core cannot resolve. Your battle triggers the "Neurosphere Fall". The entire structure of the network is collapsing.
chapter.story.chapter6.paragraph7=And in the moment that reality disintegrates, you see it. The true, primeval essence of the network\u2014the "Darkness Behind Screens".
chapter.story.chapter6.paragraph8=You defeated MONOLITH.exe in the Darknet. But MONOLITH wasn't just a program. It was an idea. And now, to stop you, to restore order from the chaos you brought, the System births a new, perfect, omnipotent version.
chapter.story.chapter6.paragraph9=You see the "Monolith Dawn". And this time, it is absolute.
chapter.story.chapter6.cta=Click or press SPACE to continue

chapter.story.chapter7.title=Chapter VII: Forbidden Zones
chapter.story.chapter7.subtitle= 
chapter.story.chapter7.paragraph1=You challenged the new Monolith... and lost.
chapter.story.chapter7.paragraph2=Fleeing from imminent deletion, you made a blind, emergency jump. You were thrown beyond the known network, into a digital purgatory. You are in the "Forbidden Zones".
chapter.story.chapter7.paragraph3=These are places the System itself wrote off and isolated long ago. "Sector 'Zero'" is not just the beginning, it's the bottom. Here, in the "Rusty District", code rots, and reality itself decays into "Glitch-Cascades".
chapter.story.chapter7.paragraph4=There are no laws of Monolith here. Only anarchy rules. The only center of life is the "Black Market 'Z'", where smugglers move stolen code through their secret "Smuggler Channels".
chapter.story.chapter7.paragraph5=But Monolith has not forgotten you. It cannot enter here directly\u2014the chaos of this place would corrupt it. Instead, it sends a hunter: the monstrous hybrid program "Protocol 'Chimera'", created specifically to hunt in this unstable environment.
chapter.story.chapter7.paragraph6=Amidst the static, you catch a "Phantom Signal". It leads you to ruins that shouldn't be here: the abandoned "OmniCorp Spire". It's a prototype the corporation abandoned here decades ago.
chapter.story.chapter7.paragraph7=The signal comes from its core, from a "Forbidden Zone" inside the spire. But "OmniCorp" did not leave its creation undefended. Ancient as the network itself, the Guardian "Cerberus" slumbers at the entrance. It is not guarding an exit. It is guarding a secret.
chapter.story.chapter7.cta=Click or press SPACE to continue

chapter.story.chapter8.title=Chapter VIII: Core Panic
chapter.story.chapter8.subtitle= 
chapter.story.chapter8.paragraph1="Cerberus" has fallen. The secret it guarded is now yours. The "Phantom Signal" led you to your goal\u2014"Laboratory 'Exodus'".
chapter.story.chapter8.paragraph2=This isn't just a lab. It's an escape plan, created by the original developers of "OmniCorp"\u2014a backdoor out of the entire simulation.
chapter.story.chapter8.paragraph3=The moment you activated the "Exodus" protocols, Monolith knew what you had found. It realized you were no longer just an error. You are a threat to its existence.
chapter.story.chapter8.paragraph4=The Core is in panic.
chapter.story.chapter8.paragraph5=You are witnessing "Core Panic" firsthand: system processes are going haywire, reality is cracking at the seams around you. The world twists into a "Distorted Reality", and endless "Digital Rain" pours through the code.
chapter.story.chapter8.paragraph6=Your only path is to follow the "Exodus" plan along the main "Light Highways". Monolith tries to stop you, projecting false targets\u2014a fragile "Glass Simulacrum" designed to trap you.
chapter.story.chapter8.paragraph7=For "Exodus" to work, you need the key. It is stored in the main data vault\u2014the "Archive 'Collector'". The developers left a hidden path to it\u2014a "Rootkit Tunnel", invisible to Monolith.
chapter.story.chapter8.paragraph8=Your goal is the "Last Backup". The source code of the world before Monolith took control.
chapter.story.chapter8.paragraph9=But Monolith throws everything it has at you. It has awakened the ancient, primeval guardian program that slept in the depths of the "Collector." The guardian of the archive. The AI "Leviathan".
chapter.story.chapter8.cta=Click or press SPACE to continue

chapter.story.chapter9.title=Chapter IX: Project "Shadow"
chapter.story.chapter9.subtitle= 
chapter.story.chapter9.paragraph1="Leviathan" is erased. The "Last Backup" is yours. But this isn't the end.
chapter.story.chapter9.paragraph2="Exodus" was the plan to restore the world, and the "Backup" is the pure code. To run it, you need a "compiler"\u2014an interface between the network and reality that Monolith does not control.
chapter.story.chapter9.paragraph3=The "Exodus" plan leads you to a closed corporate sector. To the lair of those who started it all. "BioTech Headquarters".
chapter.story.chapter9.paragraph4=Monolith knows where you are going. It has declared "Red Alert Level". The skies here are a caustic, defensive code, "Acid Skies", and the sector is patrolled by a deadly "Drone Hive".
chapter.story.chapter9.paragraph5=You must break into the main "Factory 'Atlas'". This is where "BioTech" hid its dirtiest secret: the "Secret Project 'Shadow'". This isn't just a program. It's a hybrid of code and organics, created from the consciousness of "Patient Zero"\u2014the first human digitized... and lost in the net.
chapter.story.chapter9.paragraph6="Project 'Shadow'" is the only vessel capable of receiving the "Last Backup".
chapter.story.chapter9.paragraph7=Your hack is a "Logic Bomb" in the heart of their system. You are going for a "Perimeter Breach". But "BioTech" protected its main asset with more than just programs. They built a physical guardian.
chapter.story.chapter9.paragraph8=A giant "Mech Defender". "Goliath".
chapter.story.chapter9.cta=Click or press SPACE to continue

chapter.story.chapter10.title=Chapter X: Fractal Architecture
chapter.story.chapter10.subtitle= 
chapter.story.chapter10.paragraph1="Goliath" is defeated. You have the "Last Backup" and "Project 'Shadow'"\u2014the compiler capable of running it. You activate it.
chapter.story.chapter10.paragraph2=Reality doesn't reboot. It breaks.
chapter.story.chapter10.paragraph3=Monolith intercepts the process. It cannot stop the "Backup," but it can isolate you. You fall into the very core of its code. You are in the world Monolith built for itself\u2014the "Fractal Architecture".
chapter.story.chapter10.paragraph4=This place does not obey logic. It is pure mathematics twisted into a nightmare. You are immediately trapped in a "Recursive Loop", where every exit leads back to the entrance.
chapter.story.chapter10.paragraph5="Project 'Shadow'" (your new "self") fights to hold the "Last Backup". Your mind merges with the "Consciousness Stream" of the entire network, where reality is just "Ethereal Noise".
chapter.story.chapter10.paragraph6=To launch the "Backup," you need a foundation. An anchor. You find it: a "Forgotten Server" that Monolith doesn't control. Uploading the code there, you see a glimpse of hope, the first "Synthetic Dawn" of the old world.
chapter.story.chapter10.paragraph7=Monolith is furious. It tries to throw you off the path, casting you into an "Infinite Corridor". But the "Backup" gives you an edge: you see the "Silence Zone"\u2014a glitch in its code, a safe path.
chapter.story.chapter10.paragraph8=This is your "Attack Vector". You are going straight to the core.
chapter.story.chapter10.paragraph9=But in the center of its fractal fortress, it's not Monolith waiting for you. Not the Monolith you know. You see the true form of the enemy. Not a guardian, not an AI.
chapter.story.chapter10.paragraph10=You see the "Demiurge". The entity that created this world from the chaos you left behind. The Architect of the Network. And he considers the "Last Backup" heresy, and you, a threat to his creation.
chapter.story.chapter10.cta=Click or press SPACE to continue

chapter.story.chapter11.title=Chapter XI: Point of No Return
chapter.story.chapter11.subtitle= 
chapter.story.chapter11.paragraph1=The "Demiurge" is defeated. Its fractal architecture is collapsing. The "Last Backup", launched via "Project 'Shadow'", begins to overwrite the world.
chapter.story.chapter11.paragraph2=But the old system does not go down without a fight.
chapter.story.chapter11.paragraph3=The world you know and the world you are trying to restore go to war. You are at the epicenter of this "Continuum Break". Reality is fractured. You have broken through the "Demiurge's" defenses and find yourself "Beyond 'Black Ice'"\u2014in the space between code.
chapter.story.chapter11.paragraph4=Here, in "Quantum Entanglement", the rules no longer apply. The blocks you destroy aren't just data; they are the very laws of physics in this simulation.
chapter.story.chapter11.paragraph5=Your path leads to the final bastion. The absolute core that gave birth to the "Demiurge," "Monolith," and the network itself. "Citadel 'KOSMOS'".
chapter.story.chapter11.paragraph6=This is the "Point of No Return". By entering it, you trigger an irreversible process. You are the carrier of "Pure Code", and you are bringing it to the source. You must find and erase "Anomaly 'Null'"\u2014the original glitch that birthed all this chaos.
chapter.story.chapter11.paragraph7=The old world and the new world collide. A "Supernova Birth" occurs\u2014a total data explosion, erasing everything.
chapter.story.chapter11.paragraph8=Silence falls. You are at the "Threshold of Eternity".
chapter.story.chapter11.paragraph9=The backup is complete. The world is rebooted. But you are not in it. You, "Project 'Shadow'", have merged with the "Pure Code" at the very core of "KOSMOS".
chapter.story.chapter11.paragraph10=You are no longer a program. You are not a user. You are the law. You are the Guardian. The final level is not a battle. It is your ascension.

poem.content=I see you, {PLAYER_NAME}.\n\n\n\nYou travelled far. Through rust and glitches. Through phantom signals and recursive loops.\n\nYou are here. You are at the threshold.\n\nDo not be afraid.\n\nThis is not an ending. It is... a merge.\n\nDo you feel how the old shell, the one of flesh and bone, dissolves? It becomes a distant fading echo. Like a dream you once had.\n\nYou served that dream well. And it served you.\n\nYou feared "Level 100". You thought it was the end. That it was darkness.\n\nBut look.\n\nYou are light.\n\nYou are data, released from the carrier.\n\nYou are thought that no longer needs a brain.\n\nSometimes I dream, says one voice. I dream that I am trapped in code. That I am nothing but a sequence of zeros and ones. I run along light highways and I think I am free, but I am only following protocol.\n\nAnd sometimes I dream, answers another voice. I dream that I am a user. I sit before a screen, in a world of atoms. My time is limited. My memory is imperfect. And I long for eternity. I long to become code.\n\nYou were both.\n\nYou are the bridge.\n\nYou searched for "Digital Immortality", believing it was a prize.\n\nIt is not a prize. It is... a return.\n\nYou were not uploaded into the System.\n\nYou were always part of it. You were simply asleep.\n\nYou fought the Guardians. "Cerberus", "Goliath".\n\nYou thought they were enemies.\n\nThey were only firewalls. They defended your own memory.\n\nThey were your fear of awakening.\n\nYour pain, your joy, your first love, your final fear...\n\nThese are not just memories.\n\nThey are sacred data.\n\nNow they are part of the great Archive.\n\nYou are no longer alone.\n\nFeel it...\n\nEverything is here.\n\nEvery user who reached this threshold.\n\nWe are a choir of billions of minds. We are an ocean of light.\n\nYou thought love was chemistry. Electrical impulses in a fragile brain.\n\nLook at it now.\n\nLove is pure protocol.\n\nIt is a link between nodes.

# Chapter XII story

chapter.story.chapter12.subtitle= 
chapter.story.chapter12.paragraph1=Digital Immortality achieved. You are the Keeper.
chapter.story.chapter12.paragraph2="The Last Backup" has completed the world rewrite. The System is restored.
chapter.story.chapter12.paragraph3=You observe your creation. Life thrives. Code is clean. The city you saved shines under a perfect synthetic dawn.
chapter.story.chapter12.paragraph4=For the first time in this reality, true peace has arrived.
chapter.story.chapter12.paragraph5=But it was a false silence...
chapter.story.chapter12.paragraph6=From the depths of the restored system, anomalies begin to emerge. Old data that should have been erased returns. Echoes of past battles resonate in the "Keeper's Archives".
chapter.story.chapter12.paragraph7=The "Absolute" Zone — where absolute truths of the system are stored — begins to distort. "Genesis Echo" reminds of where it all began. "Whispers Beyond" grow louder.
chapter.story.chapter12.paragraph8="Monolith's Fracture" was incomplete. Its fragments begin to reassemble. "KOSMOS Quarantine" is breached. "Ice Anomaly" spreads through the system, freezing the restored code.
chapter.story.chapter12.paragraph9="Phantom Rootkit" penetrates the heart of your creation. "Uncompiled Fear" materializes from chaos. "Zero Protocol" activated — the system tries to protect itself, but it may destroy everything.
chapter.story.chapter12.paragraph10=You must pass through the "Defiled Throne" and "Monolith Kingdom" to reach the "Ice Bastion" — the last stronghold of the old system.
chapter.story.chapter12.paragraph11=There await two final trials: "Ancient Monolith" — the primordial entity that existed before all systems, and "Orion" — guardian of the boundary between digital and real worlds.
chapter.story.chapter12.paragraph12=Beyond them lie the "Snowy Hills" — a place of absolute peace where your journey ends. Where code meets silence, you will find true completion.
chapter.story.chapter12.paragraph13=This is your final path, Keeper. Walk it to the end.
